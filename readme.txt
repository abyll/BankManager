Bank Manager, project for Software Testing.
Features 3rd-party menu system to create and manage accounts (both savings and loans).
It also simulates month-by-month interest and billing.

Interests and accounts need to be set up at beginning of program before operation; no persistence was implemented.

note:
This was a quickly-built program, to hand off to other students for testing purposes; some bugs were intentionally left in as a challenge.
I had also picked up a heavily functional programming style after an analysis of programming languages before this program, and it shows.
